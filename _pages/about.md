I am an Assistant Professor in Public and International Affairs at the <a href="https://uniweb.uottawa.ca/view/profile/members/Myriam-Gr-goire-Zawilski?lang=en">at the University of Ottawa</a>.


My **research** is at the intersection of **environmental and innovation policy**.  I study how **public policy shapes the development and diffusion of technologies needed to advance decarbonization goals**. 

My fields of specialization are **environmental and energy policy**, and **policy process**.
